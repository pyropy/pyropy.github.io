I am a software developer with an interest in distributed systems, functional programming and software engineering in general.

Lately I've been focusing most of my time on building blockchain based products on Filecoin, Cardano and Ethereum blockchains.

Some of the technologies and tools that I have been using lately are:

* Golang
* TypeScript/JavaScript
* IPFS
* Relational databases like PostgreSQL
* NoSQL databases like LevelDB, Redis, etc.

If you need help with above mentioned technologies, feel free to reach me email me at [stankovic.srdjo@gmail.com][email] or connect with me on [Linkedin].

I also try to contribute as much as possible to open-source. Some of my most popular projects are:

* [fastapi-socketio](https://github.com/pyropy/fastapi-socketio) with over 160 ⭐️
* [web3-cardano-token](https://github.com/pyropy/web3-cardano-token) with over 20 ⭐️

If you are interested about rest of my projects, hop to my [GitHub](https://github.com/pyropy) profile.
